# ieee-ops-fall-21

In the Fall 2021 semester, I participated in the Arduino Open Project Series (OPS) hosted by my the Stony Brook University IEEE chapter. I created 4 projects involving Arduino Nano microcontroller unit boards. I wired the circuits based on existing schematics and wrote the code based on existing Arduino libraries and examples.

## Week 1

I created an LED blinker with its blinking rate controlled by a potentiometer.

## Week 2

I created a music player that selected between three different songs based on a potentiometer.

## Week 3

I created a distance sensor that controlled the brightness of an indicator LED based on the reading of an IR phototransistor.

## Week 4

I created a "red light, green light" game that would blink an LED 3 times for a correct button press corresponding to the light color and 1 time for an incorrect button press. I implemented serial communications between 2 Arduino boards to communicate button press signals and compare each signal with the color of the active LED.
